Also please check ‘https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/‘ for the instruction on how to use libsvm.

For dataset of sequences used for the 3 models, please refer to ’https://huggingface.co/datasets/liyunpei/probiotic_sequence](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liyunpei/probiotic_sequence‘. 

Sorry about the mess of the code here, if you are interested in or have question about this work by any chance, please don't hesitate to raise my attention by any means.
